# USER STORY 1 - Multiplecation (Chaptor3)
As a user of the application, I want to be presented with a random multiplication problem so that I can solve it using mental calculation and exercise my brain.

To make this work, you need to build a minimal skeleton of the web application. Therefore, split the user story into several subtasks:

Create a basic service with business logic.

Create a basic API to access this service (REST API).

Create a basic web page to ask the users to solve that calculation.

This chapter focuses on Tasks 1 and 2. After creating the skeleton of your first Spring Boot application, you’ll use test-driven development to build the main logic of this component: generating multiplication challenges and verifying attempts from the users to solve those challenges. Then, you’ll add the controller layer that implements the REST API. You’ll learn about the advantages of this layered design.
